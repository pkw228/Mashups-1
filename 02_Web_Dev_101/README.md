##### V. Discussion - Project #1 Due Week 5 (Tuesday 09/30)
* Create a single web page experience that, upon user input, responds with data from at least 2 web apis. One possible approach to this assignment would be to design the experience around answering a question for the user. An example of this is [doineedanumbrella.com](http://doineedanumbrella.com/). But **(1)** a user needs to "trigger" an event, **(2)** data needs to be requested via AJAX from two APIs, and **(3)** the page should update appropriately. Your completed assignment should include a .html file, a .css file, and a .js file.

##### VI. Homework
* Read - [Javascript section of Ch.3 - Interactive Data Viz for the Web by Scott Murray](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/index.html) up to but not including the section on SVGs
* Read - [Javascript 101](http://learn.jquery.com/javascript-101/) up through the section on Functions
* Watch - [Lynda.com: Javascript Essential Training Section 2 - Core Javascript Syntax (56 mins)](http://www.nyu.edu/lynda)
* Watch - [Lynda.com - Introducing the Javascript Language: Section 6 Functions - Basic Uses of Functions (4 mins))](http://www.nyu.edu/lynda)
* Install - A JS Linter for your Text Editor (I use [Sublime Linter](http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/identify-code-errors-sublime-linter/) for Sublime)
* Complete & Post - answers to the 3 code exercises at the end of [Eloquent JS 2nd Edition Preview Ch.2 - Looping A Triangle, FizzBuzz, & ChessBoard](http://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html). The code can be included as part of this week's online journal entry. (As an alternative, you can create a [Github Gyst](https://gist.github.com/) and put the link to your gyst in your online journal post. Please also create a .html and .js file. Your code should be written in the .js file as functions which should be executable in the browser console when you load the .html file. In your .html file, you only need to write some basic markup stating the names of the 3 functions to run in the console. 
* Think & Post - idea(s) for Assignment #1, this should include at minimum a paragraph description of what you're thinking about doing, how the data flow might work, and what the experience of a user visiting the site would be like. Be prepared to present your idea(s) in class.
